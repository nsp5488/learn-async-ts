Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

First, sum2DArray is called with the array2D defined above, 
then the actual summation is set as an asynchronous call within the function and sum2DArray returns the promise from the asynchronous call.
Then, sum2DArray is called with an empty array, which returns a rejected promise. 
Finally, the first call to sum2DArray resolves and returns the summed value of array2D.
